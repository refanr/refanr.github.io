I'm Reynir, married with two young daughters. 
I enjoy walking our dog, lifting weights and playing music.
I suffered an injury a few years back and had to reevaluate my career, 
so I went back to school and am currently two thirds of the way through 
my BSc degree in software engineering.
My current academic interests are in web programming, and I will be taking
courses on web services and another on networks in the fall. 
Another area of academic interest is computer games and 
I will be taking courses on computer graphics and game making in the fall as well.
